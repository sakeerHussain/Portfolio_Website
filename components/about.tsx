        After working as a robotics instructor{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">robotics instructor</span>, I discovered
        my true passion for programming and decided to make a career shift. I
        enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. There's a unique thrill in breaking down a
        complex issue and, after much thought and effort, finally arriving at
        the perfect solution. My core stack is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with TypeScript and Next.js. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.
